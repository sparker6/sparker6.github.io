I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Northeastern University, affiliated with the Community to Community (C2C) public policy initiative and the Bouv√© College of Health Sciences. I am a quantitative social scientist applying causal inference and machine learning methods to research in violence reduction, and in particular gun violence and policing.  

I hold a PhD in Health Policy with an economics cognate from the University of Michigan's School of Public Health as well as an MS and MPP from the University of Chicago. Previously, I worked as a senior data scientist. 

I will join Northwestern University as a Research Assistant Professor in the Feinburg School of Medicine in the fall of 2024.
