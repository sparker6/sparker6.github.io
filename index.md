I am a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine in the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University. I am a quantitative social scientist applying causal inference and machine learning methods to research in violence reduction, and in particular gun violence and policing.  

I hold a PhD in Health Policy with an economics cognate from the University of Michigan's School of Public Health as well as an MS and MPP from the University of Chicago. Previously, I worked as a senior data scientist.
