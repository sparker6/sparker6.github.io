I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Northeastern University, affiliated with the Community to Community (C2C) public policy initiative and the Bouv√© College of Health Sciences. I am a quantitative social scientist with research interests in violence reduction, and in particular gun violence. I hold a PhD in Health Policy with an economics cognate from the University of Michigan's School of Public Health. Previously, I worked as a senior data scientist.
