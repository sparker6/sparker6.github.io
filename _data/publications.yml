  description: "With Catherine Barber and Philip J. Cook. For every fatal shooting in the United States, detailed information from reports of coroners or medical examiners, police departments, and other sources is recorded in the National Violent Death Reporting System. There is no such system in place for nonfatal shootings, which far outnumber fatalities. We discuss additional reforms needed to generate timely, accurate, publicly accessible data from hospitals and police."

  description: "The majority of gun violence in the United States does not result in physical injury and therefore cannot be completely measured using hospital data. To measure the full scope of gun violence, the nationâ€™s crime reporting systems that collect police reports of crimes committed with a firearm are vital. However, crime data reporting conventions may underestimate gun violence in the U.S. This paper compares crime data sources to assess underestimation of gun violence."

  description: "With Lauren Gilbert and Lauren Schechter. We use medical claims data to estimate the extent to which emergency department visits by women for assault and abuse injuries changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that while overall emergency department use by female assault patients decreased, severely injured patients continued to seek medical treatment for injuries, particularly in cases of assaults with guns."
