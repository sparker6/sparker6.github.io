  description: "With Catherine Barber and Philip J. Cook. For every fatal shooting in the United States, detailed information from reports of coroners or medical examiners, police departments, and other sources is recorded in the National Violent Death Reporting System. There is no such system in place for nonfatal shootings, which far outnumber fatalities. We discuss additional reforms needed to generate timely, accurate, publicly accessible data from hospitals and police."

  description: "The majority of gun violence in the United States does not result in physical injury and therefore cannot be completely measured using hospital data. To measure the full scope of gun violence, the nation’s crime reporting systems that collect police reports of crimes committed with a firearm are vital. However, crime data reporting conventions may underestimate gun violence in the U.S. This paper compares crime data sources to assess underestimation of gun violence."

  description: "This cross-sectional study of 22 years of data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System Firearm Injury Surveillance Study used natural language processing of unstructured medical text combined with machine learning models to classify the location of nonfatal gunshot injuries. Contrary to existing national estimates of these injuries that indicate they occur most often in homes, this analysis found that these injuries occur most often in the street or highway."

  description: "With Lauren Gilbert and Lauren Schechter. We use medical claims data to estimate the extent to which emergency department visits by women for assault and abuse injuries changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that while overall emergency department use by female assault patients decreased, severely injured patients continued to seek medical treatment for injuries, particularly in cases of assaults with guns."

  description: "With Megan E. Collins, Thomas L. Scott and Charles F. Wellford. Information is limited on how firearms move from legal possession to illegal possession and use in criminal activities, largely because of data collection capacity and a lack of recent, exhaustive recovery data across jurisdictions. This article includes both an analysis of firearms trace data and prisoner interviews across multiple jurisdictions: New Orleans, Louisiana, Prince George’s County, Maryland, and Chicago, Illinois. Findings indicate that recoveries and trace successes vary across jurisdictions and by type of crime."

  description: "With Philip J. Cook and Harold A. Pollack. This paper contributes original empirical data on the gun transactions that arm offenders in Chicago. Conducted in the fall of 2013, data come from of an open-ended survey of 99 inmates of Cook County Jail that focused on a subset of violence-prone individuals with access to firearms. Respondents obtain most of their guns from their social network of personal connections. Rarely is the proximate source either direct purchase from a gun store, or theft."
